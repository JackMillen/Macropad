# Macropad
## What is it?
This is a small USB Keyboard with rotary encoders designed to have shortcuts assigned to them
## WTF was the warning in the description
I don't know what I'm doing. My code works, but it's not written in a way that is particularly understandable. the same applies for my 3D models, I haven't modelled this in a way that's easy to modify. It works enough for me. This project was designed for me to use and no-one else. The only reason this repository exists is a place to store the code. You can do with this how you want. Just be warned.
## Main Principal
The Macropad is recognised by the PC as a keyboard+mouse+joystick+serial device. The buttons on the Macropad output an f13-f24 keypress. Autohotkey listens for these keypresses and outputs the appropriate shortcut. I also added a 3-way switch to the Macropad so you can have different layers to the macros
